\subsection*{Overview}

Human Detection module for A\+C\+ME Robotics with\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item cmake
\item googletest
\end{DoxyItemize}

We are designing a new human detection module by incorporating high-\/quality software engineering practices for Acme Robotics to take our deliverable, finish development, and integrate it into their product.

Detection and avoidance of human obstacles play a crucial role in any self-\/driving system. The design and development of real-\/time obstacle detection systems are currently one of the most demanding components in the autonomous industry. To address real-\/life problems involved in obstacle detection, a plethora of sensors such as L\+I\+D\+A\+Rs, Radars, and cameras, are being used in the industry. We are making use of the most readily available resource, images, to identify human obstacles.

Our module will be able to identify multiple humans in an image. The final deliverable of our module will be a set of images with location information of the detected humans. The robot\textquotesingle{}s system will be able to use this location information. We are assuming the input and output of our module to be a set of static images.

The module is still under development. After the final stage of development, the module will be capable of detecting multiple humans within a frame. We will add results and performance examples by the end of phase 2.

\subsection*{Install Open\+CV}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The module utilizes features of Open\+CV.
\item Although the repository contains Open\+CV library under the vendor directory, please update you system with necessary dependencies.
\item Run the commands below to install Open\+CV dependencies before cloning the repository\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 sudo apt-get install build-essential
2 sudo apt-get install cmake git libgtk2.0-dev pkg-config libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev
3 sudo apt-get install python-dev python-numpy libtbb2 libtbb-dev libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libtiff-dev
       libjasper-dev libdc1394-22-dev
\end{DoxyCode}

\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Standard install via command-\/line}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Switch to the directory where you want to clone this repository
\item Run the following command\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 git clone --recursive https://travis-ci.org/urastogi885/humanDetectionModule
2 mkdir build
3 cd build/
4 cmake ..
5 make
\end{DoxyCode}

\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Accessing the U\+ML Diagrams}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Open the directory of the project
\item Access U\+ML diagrams from the {\itshape initial} folder located within {\itshape U\+ML} sub-\/directory
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Run}

Within the {\itshape build} sub-\/directory, run\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 ./app/shell-app
\end{DoxyCode}
 This command will show nothing after execution as implementation has not been completed yet.

\subsection*{Test}

Within the {\itshape build} sub-\/directory, run\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 ./test/cpp-test
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{Demo}

\subsection*{Phase-\/1 Issues}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item T\+DD not completed for all classes such as \hyperlink{classImageOutput}{Image\+Output} 
\end{DoxyItemize}
